# OSSM
Open Source Social Media Platform That I'm planning to wirte very soon in Fastapi and Peewee in python 
I'll likely add the snowflake python library for helping create IDS for the different users made...

This new platform will have the following features...

- Logins with non-trackable capchas.
- Zero Paywalls (You don't need to log in to view your favorite person)
- No Ads / As long as the person hosting is ok with no ads...
- Easy to acess api for developers and webscrapers who want to view thier favorite creators differently
This will prevent the wasting of resources (This will never be paywalled)...

- Built-in-Features to be able to host your site as a tor hidden service....

- Unlike Searx this tool will be easy to install as well as compiled as an executable file for those who don't want useless files.
- There will always be native windows and linux and apple support...
- passwords are hashed with bcrypt

# WHY ?

This project was prompted when Twitter was paywalled and Reddit as well. This is when I said that enough is enough so I wanted to
claim the name for this repository and I will be programming this soon. All the giant corperations say that if you don't like something 
make your own. So that's what I'll be doing... :) 
Here are more of my reasons down below I'll add more links and reasons soon...

# Recomendations
When You moderate your own instance these things should be considered or taken into account

- Bandwith (This is a big one)
- Cost for hosting user profiles, Videos, Text and images...
- Diskspace The Database will get very big very fast if you're not careful with it...
- What should or shouldn't be allowed on your platform including and also complying with the laws based on where you live...

I hope your excited for this new freedom wave coming soon and I hope that this program will teach you some things.

I'm using GPL3 because I don't think that what I make here should be abused But I might consider just unlicensing this software all together,  However I encoruage you to customize your own html formats as you wish...
