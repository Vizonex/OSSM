# OSSM
Open Source Social Media Platform That I'm planning to wirte very soon in Fastapi and Peewee in python 

This new platform will have the following features...

- Logins with a non-trackable capchas.
- Zero Paywalls
- No Ads
- Easy to acess api for developers and webscrapers who want to view thier favorite creators differently
- Unlike Searx this tool will be easy to install as well as compiled as an executable file for those who don't want useless files...

# WHY ?

This project was prompted when Twitter was paywalled and Reddit as well. This is when I said that enough is enough so I wanted to
claim the name for this repository and I will be programming this soon. All the giant cooperations say that if you don't like something 
make your own so that's what I'll be doing... :)
