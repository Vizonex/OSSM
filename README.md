# OSSM
Open Source Social Media Platform That I'm planning to wirte very soon in Fastapi and Peewee in python 

This new platform will have the following features...

- Logins with a non-trackable capchas.
- Zero Paywalls (You don't need to log in to view your favorite person)
- No Ads / As long as the person hosting is ok with no ads...
- Easy to acess api for developers and webscrapers who want to view thier favorite creators differently
This will prevent the wasting of resources (This will never be paywalled)...

- Unlike Searx this tool will be easy to install as well as compiled as an executable file for those who don't want useless files.
- There will always be native windows and linux and apple support...

# WHY ?

This project was prompted when Twitter was paywalled and Reddit as well. This is when I said that enough is enough so I wanted to
claim the name for this repository and I will be programming this soon. All the giant cooperations say that if you don't like something 
make your own. So that's what I'll be doing... :) 

# Recomendations
When You moderate your own instance these things should be considered or taken into account

- Bandwith (This is a big one)
- Cost for hosting user profiles, Videos, Text and images...
- Diskspace The Database will get very big very fast if you're not careful with it...
- What should or shouldn't be allowed on your platform including complying with the laws based on where you live...
